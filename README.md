# ChromaBot
Chromabot is a *source-available* Discord bot for
Chromaverse which serves to replace moderation bots
and set up a project which all of the community can
collaberate to. Ultimately giving people in the server
a chance to be creative and try out programming

The bot will mainly be written in Javascript as it isn't a
pain in the posterior plus it is very easy to use
